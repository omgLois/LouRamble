👋 Hi, I’m @Lou 👋

👀 I am a Systems Engineer which involves the design and implementation of deployment methodologies for various resources, Websites, Reporting Services and Apps etc.
 
✨ Recently I have been learning node.js, npm and Typescript for ADO Extension development for use in Pipelines for automation of things like Cloudflare tasks.
 
🌱  I’m interested in developing Engineering and Software Development best practice, CICD Pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, Storage Management as well as governance and audit around data, code reviews, data policy,  file and folder management and tagging of digital assets for now.

🌱 I’m currently learning ... Lots of storage management solutions and integrations.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on task and extension development and shared tool development.
